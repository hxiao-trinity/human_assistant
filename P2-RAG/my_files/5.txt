Group 5 is designing a Healthy Dining Recommender that guides students toward balanced meal choices in the campus dining halls. The app will categorize food by nutrition levels and offer gentle suggestions without shaming the user. Students can log goals—such as more protein, fewer sugary drinks, or more vegetables—and the system will produce daily recommendations. The team emphasizes that food is personal and emotional, so the app is designed to be supportive rather than judgmental. Over time, the recommender will learn eating patterns and send short reminders before peak dining hours, helping users make thoughtful choices. The final product aims to blend convenience, nutrition awareness, and emotional well-being.
