Group 2 is developing a Social App for Programmers, a platform where coders can share snippets, review each other’s work, and form study or project groups. The target audience is university students who feel isolated or overwhelmed in their early CS courses. The app will include a tagging system for languages and frameworks, helping users quickly find content related to Python, React, Rust, or other technologies. A lightweight gamification system will award points for meaningful discussion and helpful code reviews, encouraging positive behavior. In future iterations, the team wants to add optional anonymous posting so beginners can ask questions without fear of embarrassment. The long-term goal is to make the academic coding journey more collaborative, reducing frustration and helping students connect with peers.
