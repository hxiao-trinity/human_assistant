Group 1 is building a Smart Grocery Planning App designed to help busy students plan their weekly meals more efficiently. The system will allow users to input dietary preferences, budgets, and available cooking time, then automatically generate meal plans and grocery lists. A key feature of this app is its ability to reduce food waste by tracking expiration dates and suggesting recipes based on what the user already has in their kitchen. The team plans to use a simple recommendation model to tailor suggestions to user behavior over time. In the final stage of the project, the app will include an optional sharing feature that allows roommates and family members to coordinate grocery shopping, avoiding duplicate purchases. This project aims to improve daily student life through organization, cost-savings, and convenience.
