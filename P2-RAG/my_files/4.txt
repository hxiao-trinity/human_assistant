Group 4 is building a Campus Navigation App that helps new students find classrooms, offices, printers, and quiet study spaces. Many students get lost during their first semester, especially on large or confusing campuses. This app will combine floor maps, walking directions, and building information into a single interface. A bookmarking system will let students save frequently visited locations, and a “least crowded route” option will avoid bottleneck hallways during peak class-change hours. In the future, the team plans to integrate real-time sensor data about room capacity and noise levels. The goal is to reduce daily navigation stress and help all students feel more comfortable on campus.
