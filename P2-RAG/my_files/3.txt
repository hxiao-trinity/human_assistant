Group 3 is creating a Machine Learning Weather Forecast Assistant that generates simple recommendations based on local weather. Instead of just reporting temperature and wind speed, the app will produce plain-language suggestions like “wear a light jacket” or “bring an umbrella.” The model will learn from historical weather and user feedback to improve its messaging over time. This project focuses on user-centric output rather than pure meteorological accuracy. The students also plan to support special cases, such as guidance for runners, cyclists, or people who walk long distances on campus. Through this solution, the team hopes to show how machine learning can be paired with everyday decision-making in a friendly and approachable manner.
